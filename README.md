# CEBD-1151---Big-Data-Analytics-for-Business
In this repository, I include some of the work I have done for CEBD 1151 - Big Data Analytics for Business, one of the required courses for the Diploma in Big Data at Concordia University. 

My Jupyter notebook is too large to be uploaded on GitHub, however. Will send it on request.
