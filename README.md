# CEBD-1151---Big-Data-Analytics-for-Business
In this repository, I include some of the work I have done for CEBD 1151 - Big Data Analytics for Business, one of the required courses for the Diploma in Big Data at Concordia University. 

Please note that <ins>this Jupyter notebook is too large for Github</ins> because I developed data visualizations using Plotly. Will send it on request.
